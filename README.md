Damez Coding World Portfolio:

This page here is my first ever portfolio page i've done in my life!
On this site here you will see an about me and my love for gaming and streaming as well as content creation. I chose the colors, grey, dark blue and black, as they are the color ways that represnt my brand and logo.

My three sub sections on my page are pictures and discriptions of my YouTube, Instagram and Twitch channels. if you click the link tabs at the top of the page, they will navigate you to the desired locations

Lastly at the bottom of the page i have my contact me footer that will provide addtional information on how to reach me directly.

*ScreenShots and used images are in the "imgages" folder
